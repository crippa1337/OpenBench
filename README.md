# OpenBench

OpenBench is an open-source Chess Engine Testing Framework for UCI engines. OpenBench provides a lightweight interface and client to facilitate running fixed-game tests as well as SPRT tests to benchmark changes to engines for performance and stability. OpenBench supports [Fischer Random Chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess960).
